 tct_neutral_struggle.0002.t: "Goslar, Silver Mines and the Saxons"
 tct_neutral_struggle.0002.desc: "I stand within the Imperial Palace of Goslar looking out to the fields below...the Saxons—a thorn in the flesh, a thorn that dates back to the reign of my late father. Goslar, this palace which is supposed to signify unity, has instead become a chokehold upon their livelihoods. It's a bitter draught to swallow, but who am I to deny the burdens of lineage? \n\nYet, I stand resolute in my intentions. The silver mines of Rammelsberg, the fortresses that rise like dragons along the Harz mountains—these are not mere whims of a tyrant. They are bastions of imperial strength, my strength as emperor, My ministeriales, their Swabian roots notwithstanding, are the sinew and bone of this vision. If the Saxons see this as a threat, it is only because they are blinded by their own insecurities. They'll soon come to understand, either willingly or through the firm hand of my governance."
 tct_neutral_struggle.0002.a: "All in good time.."

 tct_neutral_struggle.0003.t: "Goslar, Silver Mines and the Salians"
 tct_neutral_struggle.0003.desc: "Dark are the days since Henry IV ascended the throne, casting his shadow over Saxon lands like a hawk circling its prey. My heart beats with indignation as I hear of the Emperor's deeds, his Rhenish Franconian heritage betraying no love for us. Goslar, that accursed palace, has not only consumed our wealth but has become a symbol of subjugation. I can feel the resentment simmering among my countrymen, a cauldron set to boil over. \n\nIn the heart of the Harz mountains, he plunders our silver and erects fortresses as if adorning his realm with trophies of conquest. The Harzburg castle and its ilk serve as reminders of his authority. But the true insult lies in the Swabian ministeriales he has unleashed upon us, men who raid our villages and tarnish our honor. Henry might see this as an assertion of royal power, but we see it for what it is—an invasion, a threat to our existence. This unrest finds echoes even among the Empire's great princes. If Henry believes that castles and ministeriales can quash the Saxon spirit, he is gravely mistaken. The time for passive support is dwindling; the moment for action draws near."

 tct_neutral_struggle.1001.desc.a: "I find myself holding a sealed letter inked with [emperor.GetTitledFirstName]'s crest.

His performance is flawless, as we had agreed. The court believes this to be his moment of bravery, but the path ahead was charted long before he spoke. \n\n"These are grave accusations," I declare, my voice steady.

His aim is clear: to eliminate a threat, one of the few [saxons.GetName]'s' who might stand against him.\n\nStill, I ride on. For the sake of my house, I must face what lies ahead.

Otto's fate has already been sealed—the emperor intends to remove him from power. \n\nThe chancellor leans closer, his voice lowering. "[emperor.GetTitledFirstName] offers you a great opportunity. Swear your loyalty to him, divorce your Nordheim wife, and sever all ties with her family. In exchange, the Duchy of Bavaria will be yours."

Some rebels laugh at the carnage, their cruelty unchecked, while others falter, horror etched into their faces as the scale of their comrades' savagery became clear. \n\nThis is no longer rebellion—it is sacrilege.
